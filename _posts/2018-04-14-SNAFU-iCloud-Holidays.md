title: SNAFU&colon; iCloud Holidays

This morning my iOS devices told me tomorrow is Easter.  As I logged into my MacBook, it told me the same.  The fact is, though, that Easter was almost two weeks ago on 01 Apr.  That's the date many sources give, including [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/common/easter-sunday).

I checked into the "Christian Holidays" calendar in Apple's Calendar.app to see why the holiday has been given the wrong date.  Their definition of Easter is: "Every Year on the 3rd Sunday of April".  That may be a good approximation for most years, but since the holiday is based on the moon, it will be off some years, like this year.

Apple's calendar came from: `webcal://p03-calendarws.icloud.com/ca/subscribe/1/nMJ-EVR7LENLfhDIavhUHSb91MCSIru8cFTPMFnCfxkSzq1V6A4d5kUNYCjr7g0341sIo3eMdlUxFDrjjpHjC2IWidq4Cod4qCaSJaKjghY`.

I will delete that calendar and find a more accurate source.
